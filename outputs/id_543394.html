            <p>The research group of Jun. Prof. Natalie K&amp;amp;ouml;hler, PhD, Department of Internal Medicine I (Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation), University Medical Center Freiburg and Centre For Integrative Biological Signalling Studies (CIBSS), University of Freiburg, is currently looking for a highly motivated</p><p>PhD Student in the field of tumor immunology and T cell based immunotherapies (m/w/d)</p> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>Our laboratory focusses on the identification of novel targets for immunotherapies in hematological malignancies, in particular key regulators of immune checkpoint molecules. Furthermore, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms of and find novel therapeutic options for cancer immunotherapy-related adverse events. To this aim, we use classical genetic mouse models and T cell characterization approaches as well as novel NGS-based technologies, in particular single-cell RNA and immune receptor sequencing with an in-lab 10X Genomics system.</p>
