Tempor&amp;amp;auml;r kann dieser Gasaustausch mit Hilfe technischer Systeme (z.

Die steigende Diskrepanz von Organspendern zu Organempf&amp;amp;auml;ngern f&amp;amp;uuml;hrt jedoch zu einer zunehmenden Sterblichkeit dieser Patienten auf der Warteliste zur Transplantation. &amp;amp;Uuml;bergeordnetes <strong>Ziel dieses Projektes</strong> daher die Entwicklung einer <strong>implantierbaren Lunge als Alternative zur Lungentransplantation.</strong><br/><br/>Derzeitige Oxygenatoren der ECMO-Systeme k&amp;amp;ouml;nnen aufgrund ihrer Geometrien und des verwendeten Materials nur tempor&amp;amp;auml;r eingesetzt werden, da der unvermeidbare Kontakt des zirkulierenden Blutes mit der Fremdoberfl&amp;amp;auml;che zur Thrombenbildung f&amp;amp;uuml;hrt.

Im Rahmen dieses Projektes sollen diese Entwicklungen in-vitro, ex-vivo als auch in-vivo in verschiedenen Tiermodellen evaluiert und analysiert werden.<br/><br/>Es erwartet Sie ein interdisziplin&amp;amp;auml;res und spannendes Forschungsfeld in engem Kontakt zur klinischen Anwendung.</p> ]]>

                Die AG Biohybridlunge der HTTG-Chirurgie und des Nieders&amp;amp;auml;chsischen Zentrums f&amp;amp;uuml;r Biomedizintechnik, Implantatforschung und Entwicklung (NIFE) sucht zum n&amp;amp;auml;chstm&amp;amp;ouml;glichen Zeitpunkt eine_n Doktorand_in (w/d/m) der Naturwissenschaften / Tiermedizin zur Durchf&amp;amp;uuml;hrung des DFG-gef&amp;amp;ouml;rderten Projekts:<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3D-Lunge &amp;amp;ndash; Implantierbare k&amp;amp;uuml;nstliche Lunge auf Basis dreidimensionaler Membranen</strong><br/>
<br/>
Patienten mit terminalen Lungenerkrankungen leiden mit Fortschreiten der Erkrankung am immer schlechter werdenden Gasaustausch der Lungen. Tempor&amp;amp;auml;r kann dieser Gasaustausch mit Hilfe technischer Systeme (z. B. maschinelle Beatmung, extrakorporale Membranoxygenierung (ECMO)) sichergestellt werden, doch die einzig wahre Therapieoption bleibt f&amp;amp;uuml;r diese Patienten die Lungentransplantation. Die steigende Diskrepanz von Organspendern zu Organempf&amp;amp;auml;ngern f&amp;amp;uuml;hrt jedoch zu einer zunehmenden Sterblichkeit dieser Patienten auf der Warteliste zur Transplantation. &amp;amp;Uuml;bergeordnetes <strong>Ziel dieses Projektes</strong> daher die Entwicklung einer <strong>implantierbaren Lunge als Alternative zur Lungentransplantation.</strong><br/>
<br/>
Derzeitige Oxygenatoren der ECMO-Systeme k&amp;amp;ouml;nnen aufgrund ihrer Geometrien und des verwendeten Materials nur tempor&amp;amp;auml;r eingesetzt werden, da der unvermeidbare Kontakt des zirkulierenden Blutes mit der Fremdoberfl&amp;amp;auml;che zur Thrombenbildung f&amp;amp;uuml;hrt. Daher werden im Rahmen dieses Projektes alternative Oberfl&amp;amp;auml;chen und Geometrien zur Oxygenatorherstellung hinsichtlicht ihrer Bio- und H&amp;amp;auml;mokompatibilit&amp;amp;auml;t evaluiert.&amp;amp;nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Da das Lungenversagen auch oft mit einem Nierenversagen einhergeht, dass ein Nierenersatzverfahren (Dialyse) notwendig macht, werden zudem die Faseranordnungen innerhalb des Oxygenators adaptiert, um mit einem System sowohl den Gasaustausch, als auch die Dialyse realisieren zu k&amp;amp;ouml;nnen. Im Rahmen dieses Projektes sollen diese Entwicklungen in-vitro, ex-vivo als auch in-vivo in verschiedenen Tiermodellen evaluiert und analysiert werden.<br/>
<br/>
Es erwartet Sie ein interdisziplin&amp;amp;auml;res und spannendes Forschungsfeld in engem Kontakt zur klinischen Anwendung.            </div>

            <![CDATA[<p>Im I<strong>nstitut f&amp;amp;uuml;r Pathologie</strong> ist zum fr&amp;amp;uuml;hestm&amp;amp;ouml;glichen Zeitpunkt eine Stelle als</p><p>Projektmanagerin/-manager (w/m/d) f&amp;amp;uuml;r das Nationale Obduktionsnetzwerk (NATON)</p><p>mit der vollen tariflich vereinbarten Arbeitszeit (38,5 Std./Wo.) zu besetzen. Die Stelle ist zun&amp;amp;auml;chst unter Ber&amp;amp;uuml;cksichtigung des WissZeitVg auf 1 Jahr befristet, eine Verl&amp;amp;auml;ngerung wird angestrebt.</p><p>In der COVID-19-Pandemie gewann die Durchf&amp;amp;uuml;hrung von Obduktionen eine gro&amp;amp;szlig;e Bedeutung. Medizinische Fachkreise und deutsche Gesundheitsbeh&amp;amp;ouml;rden erkannten relativ fr&amp;amp;uuml;h, dass die Autopsie ein notwendiges Instrument ist, um die Pathophysiologie der COVID-19-Erkrankung besser zu verstehen. Das Nationale Autopsienetzwerk (NATON) untersucht auf nationaler Ebene mittels Autopsien die Folgen der COVID-19-Pandemie und entwickelt eine &amp;amp;bdquo;Preparedness&amp;amp;ldquo;-Struktur f&amp;amp;uuml;r zuk&amp;amp;uuml;nftige Pandemief&amp;amp;auml;lle. Es werden vorhandene Strukturen gest&amp;amp;auml;rkt und innovative Ans&amp;amp;auml;tze entwickelt. Zudem unterst&amp;amp;uuml;tzt und verbessert NATON langfristig eine multizentrische Autopsieforschung in Deutschland. Wichtige Komponente von NATON ist das seit 2020 bestehende nationale Register f&amp;amp;uuml;r COVID-19 Obduktionen (<span>www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de</span>). Es sammelt zentral und elektronisch aus ganz Deutschland die Ergebnisse zu COVID-19 Obduktionen von Pathologinnen/-en, Neuropathologinnen/-en und Rechtsmedizinerinnen/-ern. Das Register zielt auf ein besseres Verst&amp;amp;auml;ndnis von COVID-19 ab und dient zudem als Vermittler von Forschungsprojekten und stellt die zentrale Stelle f&amp;amp;uuml;r Auswertungen und Datenmeldungen an Fachgesellschaften und andere Institutionen, insbesondere das Bundesministerium f&amp;amp;uuml;r Gesundheit (BMG) und das Robert-Koch Institut (RKI) dar. Das DeRegCOVID konnte bereits mehrere Forschungsprojekte erfolgreich unterst&amp;amp;uuml;tzen, u.a. Arbeiten in renommierten Zeitschriften wie Cell oder New England Journal of Medicine. Das Register wird federf&amp;amp;uuml;hrend in Aachen unter wissenschaftlich-medizinischer Leitung von Herrn Prof. Boor (Institut f&amp;amp;uuml;r Pathologie) und technischer Leitung von Herrn Prof. R&amp;amp;ouml;hrig (Institut f&amp;amp;uuml;r medizinische Informatik) geleitet.</p> ]]>

Die Stelle ist zun\u00e4chst unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung des WissZeitVg auf 1 Jahr befristet, eine Verl\u00e4ngerung wird angestrebt. In der COVID-19-Pandemie gewann die Durchf\u00fchrung von Obduktionen eine gro\u00dfe Bedeutung. Medizinische Fachkreise und deutsche Gesundheitsbeh\u00f6rden erkannten relativ fr\u00fch, dass die Autopsie ein notwendiges Instrument ist, um die Pathophysiologie der COVID-19-Erkrankung besser zu verstehen. Das Nationale Autopsienetzwerk (NATON) untersucht auf nationaler Ebene mittels Autopsien die Folgen der COVID-19-Pandemie und entwickelt eine \u201ePreparedness\u201c-Struktur f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Pandemief\u00e4lle. Es werden vorhandene Strukturen gest\u00e4rkt und innovative Ans\u00e4tze entwickelt. Zudem unterst\u00fctzt und verbessert NATON langfristig eine multizentrische Autopsieforschung in Deutschland. Wichtige Komponente von NATON ist das seit 2020 bestehende nationale Register f\u00fcr COVID-19 Obduktionen (www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de). Es sammelt zentral und elektronisch aus ganz Deutschland die Ergebnisse zu COVID-19 Obduktionen von Pathologinnen/-en, Neuropathologinnen/-en und Rechtsmedizinerinnen/-ern. Das Register zielt auf ein besseres Verst\u00e4ndnis von COVID-19 ab und dient zudem als Vermittler von Forschungsprojekten und stellt die zentrale Stelle f\u00fcr Auswertungen und Datenmeldungen an Fachgesellschaften und andere Institutionen, insbesondere das Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG) und das Robert-Koch Institut (RKI) dar. Das DeRegCOVID konnte bereits mehrere Forschungsprojekte erfolgreich unterst\u00fctzen, u.a. Arbeiten in renommierten Zeitschriften wie Cell oder New England Journal of Medicine. Das Register wird federf\u00fchrend in Aachen unter wissenschaftlich-medizinischer Leitung von Herrn Prof. Boor (Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie) und technischer Leitung von Herrn Prof. R\u00f6hrig (Institut f\u00fcr medizinische Informatik) geleitet.Aufgaben:Koordination und Weiterentwicklung von NATON und DeRegCOVID mit allen involvierten Partnerinnen/Partnern und relevanten Stakeholdern Unterst\u00fctzung und Koordination bei der Schaffung neuer Strukturen, z.B. im Bereich der digitalen Pathologie und der Anbindung an das \u00f6ffentliche Gesundheitswesen (RKI, PEI)Selbst\u00e4ndige Erarbeitung von Meldungen und Publikationen sowie Zwischenberichten und Pr\u00e4sentationenOrganisation und administrative PlanungKommunikation und Zusammenarbeit sowie die Durchf\u00fchrung von Abstimmungsprozessen mit Projektteam und \u00e4rztlichen Kolleginnen/KollegInnenUnterst\u00fctzung von Zentren im Rahmen regulatorischer Einreichungen bei Ethikkommissionen und Beh\u00f6rdenUnterst\u00fctzung und ggf.
